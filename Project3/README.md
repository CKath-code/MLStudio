# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction MLOps Pipeline

Enterprise-grade MLOps pipeline for automated used car price prediction using Azure Machine Learning.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline that automates the pricing of used cars for automobile dealerships. The solution reduces manual pricing time from hours to seconds while ensuring consistent, data-driven pricing decisions.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Automated Pricing**: 99% faster than manual processes (2-4 hours → 5 seconds)
- **High Accuracy**: Random Forest model optimized through 20+ hyperparameter configurations
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Azure ML with auto-scaling compute clusters
- **Production Ready**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
- **Model Versioning**: MLflow integration for experiment tracking and model registry

## 🏗️ Architecture

### MLOps Pipeline Components
1. **Data Processing**: Automated preprocessing and feature engineering
2. **Model Training**: Random Forest with hyperparameter optimization
3. **Model Registry**: MLflow for version control and artifact management
4. **Deployment**: Azure ML endpoints for real-time predictions
5. **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and automated retraining
